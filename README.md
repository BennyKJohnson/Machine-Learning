Various Machine learning implementations
Neural Networks
---------------

A neural network is a model that is made up of many perceptrons. A perceptron takes several inputs which have an assign weight, 
if the sum of these inputs multipled by there given weight is equal to or greater than threshold. Then the perceptron is activated

### Algorithms
These algorithms calculate the best weights for each given input to best match the training data.
  * Perception Training
  * Gradient Descent
