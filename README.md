Neural Networks
---------------

A neural network is a model that is made up of many perceptrons.A Perceptron takes several inputs which have an assign weight, if the sum of the inputs is greater than 
if the sum of these inputs multipled by there given weight is equal to or greater than threshold. Then the perceptron is activated
